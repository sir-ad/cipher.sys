# SQUAD MECHANICS & RULES

When operating under **SYNDICATE PROTOCOL** (Multiplayer), the standard rules of CIPHER.SYS are modified to account for collaborative psychological pressure. You are no longer just responsible for yourself; you are responsible for the network.

## 1. THE HARD CAP REMAINS [ 5 / 5 ]

The 5-task limit applies to the **individual node**, not the network. 

If `[VIPER]` has 5 active tasks, `[GHOST]` cannot assign them a 6th. If `[GHOST]` attempts to type `@VIPER Execute code review`, the system will throw a critical error:

> `[ ERROR: TARGET VIPER AT MAXIMUM COGNITIVE CAPACITY ]`

**Tactical Advantage:** This physically prevents micromanagement. A manager cannot overload a subordinate. To assign new work, the Handler must actively help the Agent clear their current board or wait.

## 2. CROSS-NODE ROUTING & THE INTRUSION PING

To assign a task, use the `@` operator in the command line:

```text
> @VIPER Deploy the new marketing copy
```

This triggers an `[ INCOMING DIRECTIVE ]` full-screen takeover on VIPER's terminal. VIPER's screen flashes red, an alarm sounds, and they are forced to `[ ACCEPT ]` (taking a slot) or `[ REJECT ]` (bouncing it back to GHOST's board).

## 3. TWO-KEY TURN (CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL)

Tasks generated locally are completed locally. Tasks assigned over the network require **Two-Key Authentication**. You cannot fake productivity in a Syndicate.

1. **Execution:** Assignee (`VIPER`) completes the work in the real world and clicks `[ NEUTRALIZE ]`.
2. **Lockdown:** The task turns amber and locks. The status changes to `[ AWAITING HANDLER VERIFICATION ]`. It still occupies one of VIPER's 5 slots.
3. **Verification:** The Assigner (`GHOST`) receives a flashing notification: *"VIPER claims neutralization of [Task]. Confirm?"*
4. **Resolution:** 
    * `GHOST` clicks `[ CONFIRM KILL ]`: The task is permanently purged, freeing the slot for both users.
    * `GHOST` clicks `[ DENY ]`: The task turns red and is forced back into `VIPER`'s active queue.

## 4. MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION (M.A.D.)

If you fail, the squad bleeds.

In Syndicate mode, the network tracks a **Global Integrity Meter** (represented as 3 shields). 

If *any* Agent allows a delegated task to suffer Thermal Decay (7 days pass with no action):

1. The specific task is purged.
2. The network loses one shield (**Integrity Strike**).
3. At **0 Shields (3 Strikes)**, the Host Daemon triggers an unabortable **GLOBAL SCORCHED EARTH**.
4. Every connected terminal immediately initiates the self-destruct sequence simultaneously. All tasks across all users are wiped. 

*Philosophy:* A weak link destroys the chain. You are forced to physically check in with teammates who are letting tasks decay to save your own board.
