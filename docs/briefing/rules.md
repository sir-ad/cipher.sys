# RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

CIPHER.SYS enforces a strict tactical framework. Do not attempt to bypass these constraints.

## 1. CAPACITY LIMIT [ 5 / 5 ]

The human brain cannot execute 20 tasks simultaneously. CIPHER restricts input to **5 maximum directives**. 

If you hit capacity, you must either:
* `[ ENGAGE ]` and Neutralize an active target.
* `[ DISAVOW ]` (Delete) a target to free a slot.

## 2. TARGET LOCK (TUNNEL VISION)

To prevent choice paralysis, operatives must use the `[ ENGAGE ]` protocol.

Clicking `[ ENGAGE ]` on a task removes the entire UI, replacing it with a massive, high-contrast, fullscreen display of a *single objective*, alongside a live tactical stopwatch.

You have two choices while engaged:
* **NEUTRALIZE TARGET:** Complete it.
* **FALLBACK:** Abort and return to the list.

## 3. THERMAL DECAY (7 DAYS)

There is no "Someday" list. 

Every directive is tracked via a depletion bar. At **T-MINUS 2 DAYS**, the asset flashes red. At **T-MINUS 0**, the asset is permanently purged from the database. 

!!! note "PSYCHOLOGICAL DEBRIEF"
    If a task decays and dies, it was not critical. Do not mourn purged assets.

## 4. SCORCHED EARTH PROTOCOL

Upon neutralizing the final target in the ledger, the terminal determines you have no further business being here. It triggers the self-destruct countdown.

You have 10 seconds to abort, or the system executes a physical `process.exit(0)` command on the host daemon, severing the connection entirely.
